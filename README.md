## About romansjr (or Sarah)

##UPDATE
I'm learning on codecademy plus freecodecamp!

I've learned how to code in the past through classes in college. 
But now, this is my reintroduction to coding. 
I do not have a specific goal in mind. 
But I want to be able to develop/create something that's my own.
I hope this is a great learning experience for me!
Thank you for reading!
